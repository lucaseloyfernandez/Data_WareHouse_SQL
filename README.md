# SQL Data Analysis Project

## About This Project
This repository contains a complete SQL data analysis project that I developed while learning from Baraa's YouTube tutorial series (Baraa Khatib Salkini, also known as Data With Baraa.). While the project concept and learning path were guided by Baraa's excellent content, all code in this repository was written by me as I applied the concepts in real-time.

## My Learning Approach
- **Followed Along**: Watched Baraa's tutorial videos step by step
- **Hands-On Implementation**: Wrote all SQL code independently while learning
- **Concept Application**: Applied each new SQL concept immediately in practice
- **Full Project Completion**: Built the entire analysis from start to finish

## Key SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Complex Query Writing
- Data Aggregation and Analysis
- Join Operations
- Subqueries and CTEs
- Data Filtering and Sorting

## Credits
Special thanks to Baraa Khatib Salkini, also known as Data With Baraa for creating such valuable educational content that made this learning journey possible.
